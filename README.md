# CIEMatchingFunction
This program matematically calculates any color from a Spectral Reflectance distribution, and maps it to the CIE RBG color space read by your monitor.

The human eye has three sensors for color that respond to different wavelengths, and this allows us to see distinct colors.

Light sources emit energy at various wavelenths (in nm), and surfaces reflect a certain amount of energy. Thus with a given distribution of spectral reflectance, energy emitted in wavelengths, we can calculate the appropraite RGB value associated to it. The CIE matching functions are used to calculate this RGB value. This RGB value mapped within the CIE RGB color space.
